# Bias-Detector

## About the Project
The **Bias Detector** is a simple Java application designed to identify potential biases in a given text input. The program checks for specific keywords associated with various cognitive biases, such as **confirmation bias**, **availability bias**, and **hindsight bias**, among others. When a user inputs a string of text, the app scans it and highlights any words or phrases that may suggest biased thinking.

##Features

- **Bias Detection**: Identifies words associated with various cognitive biases in the user's text.
- **Multiple Bias Types**: Supports multiple types of cognitive biases like confirmation bias, availability bias, and more.
- **Simple Interaction**: User-friendly text input and output directly in the console.

## Future Updates / Roadmap

- **AI-Based Bias Detection**: Implement machine learning or natural language processing (NLP) models to intelligently detect bias in text based on context, rather than just matching predefined keywords. This will enhance the detection's accuracy and flexibility.
- **Expanded Bias Detection**: Add more bias types to the detection list (e.g., self-serving bias, in-group bias).
- **Improved User Interface**: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
- **Contextual Analysis**: Improve detection by analyzing context around keywords rather than relying solely on matching exact words.
- **Real-time Detection**: Implement real-time text analysis for web-based platforms or mobile apps.
- **Integration with Text Editors**: Build an extension or plugin for common text editors (e.g., VSCode, Word) that alerts users about potential biases as they type.
